          <p>Another type of theorem that we are sometimes called upon to
          prove is a <term>uniqueness theorem</term>.<idx><h>uniqueness theorem</h></idx>
          <idx><h>theorem</h><h>uniqueness</h></idx>
           In such a case, we
          must prove that the thing in question exists as well as prove
          that there is only one such thing. The next activity walks you
          through the structure of such an argument.</p>

      <introduction>
        <p>We want to prove the theorem <q>If <m>c,a,r\in\mathbb{R}</m>
        such that <m>c\neq 0</m> and <m>r\neq a/c</m>, then there exists a
        unique <m>x\in\mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>(ax+1)/(cx) =
        r</m>.</q></p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>The first step in a uniqueness proof is to demonstrate that
          such a beast exists. One pattern for doing this is by coming up
          with a formula for the thing (here <m>x</m>) that we need to
          have exist and showing that <m>x</m> does what it's supposed
          to. <alert>The process of how you come with the <m>x</m> is
          scratchwork that doesn't go in the proof!</alert>. Thus, we want
          to start by finding a formula for <m>x</m> so that
          <m>(ax+1)/(cx) = r</m>. Use familiar algebra skills to do
          it. What you write up for your proof is going to look like
          <q>Let <m>x=\cdots</m>. Now substituting and simplifying, we
          see:</q> starting with <m>(ax+1)/(cx)</m> and simplifying to get
          <m>r</m>.</p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>Next, we have to show that our <m>x</m> is unique. To do so,
          you assume that <m>x_1,x_2\in\mathbb{R}</m> both have the
          property required. Namely, that  <m>(ax_1+1)/(cx_1) =
        r</m> and <m>(ax_2+1)/(cx_2) =
        r</m>. Now you use algebra to show that <m>x_1=x_2</m>, which
          means that the <m>x</m> you came up with originally really is unique.</p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>What you have above likely has a lot of scratchwork in
          it. Rewrite things neatly to have a nice paragraph that proves
          the theorem.</p>
